# Monkey

An implementation of the monkey-lang specified in the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.

This is a 1:1 implementation of the language defined in the book, though I aim to do the additional challenges presented in it as well (e.g. support for Unicode / UTF-8 characters).
